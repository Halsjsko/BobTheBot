We take reasonable measures to protect the data collected by the Bot and to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration of the information. However, please note that no method of transmission or storage over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

We do not retain or store the command usage data mentioned above. It is logged temporarily for the purpose of immediate functionality and is discarded thereafter.
