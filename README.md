# Plans For The Future
Bob will only use slash commands. This ensures users can always understand how a command works as well as what all of the commands are without the use of a help command.
Bob was not made to do a specific thing, but instead will gain features that are requested by the users. Until a proper suggest command is created, you can email me with any feature requests.

# How is Bob Hosted?
Bob runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS Lite. This enables a lot of freedom in terms of feature sets because Bob no longer relies on [replit.com](replit.com). Replit was originally used, but after an outrageous price increase it was no longer viable.

# Framework
This bot is written with the [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) framework.
