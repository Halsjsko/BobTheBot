# General
The code that gives Bob life!
- [Invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=705680059809398804&permissions=1110719392886&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
# Plans For The Future
Bob will only use slash commands. This ensures users can always understand how a command works as well as what all of the commands are without the use of a help command.
Bob was not made to do a specific thing, but instead will gain features that are requested by the users. Until a proper suggest command is created, you can email me with any feature requests.
# How is Bob Hosted?
- Bob runs on an always on Repl on [replit.com](replit.com) this is a cost effective solution currently because it only costs 2 Cycles a day, where 1 Cycle is equal to 1 Cent.
- Bob also has a web server hosting a simple static website allowing for the use of [Up Time Bot](https://uptimerobot.com/). Currently I have Up Time Bot pinging this web server every 30 minutes.
# Framework
This bot is written with the [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) framework.
