# Community Guidelines

Welcome to our community! We strive to create a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone. Please take a moment to read through these guidelines to ensure a positive experience for all members when interacting with BobTheBot (Bob).

## Be Respectful

- **Respect Everyone:** Treat all members with kindness and respect. Harassment, discrimination, or any form of hate speech will not be tolerated.
- **Listen to Moderators:** Follow the instructions of the moderators. They are here to keep the community safe and enjoyable for everyone.
- **No Bullying:** Bullying or targeting individuals is strictly prohibited.

## Keep It Clean

- **No NSFW Content:** Explicit content, including images, links, or discussions, is not allowed.
- **Appropriate Language:** Use language that is appropriate for all ages. Avoid profanity and offensive language. Automatic censoring is applied in some cases, but creating a perfect system that meets everyone's needs is not possible. We are always trying to improve.
- **Spam-Free Zone:** Refrain from spamming messages, links, or images. Keep interactions with Bob meaningful and relevant.

## Safe Reporting

- **Report Issues:** If you see something that violates these guidelines, report it to the moderators using the appropriate commands. We take all reports seriously and will handle them promptly.
- **No Retaliation:** Do not retaliate against someone for reporting an issue. Retaliation is a serious offense and will be dealt with accordingly.

## Have Fun!

- **Enjoy Bob:** Use Bob's features, participate in activities, and have fun. We are here to create a welcoming space for everyone.
- **Engage Positively:** Encourage and support your fellow community members. Positive interactions help build a stronger community.

## Consequences

Violating these guidelines may result in a warning, temporary mute, or ban from using Bob, depending on the severity of the offense. Misbehaving can also result in losing access to some commands temporarily. The progression of bans is as follows:

1. First offense: 5-minute ban.
2. Second offense: 1-hour ban.
3. Third offense: 1-day ban.
4. Fourth offense: 1-week ban.
5. Fifth offense: 1-month ban.

If you offend again while still under a punishment, you will receive the next level of the ban. If you offend again after the 1-month ban, your case will be reviewed manually for a potential permanent ban.

If you have any issues with this process, please let us know and we will review your case manually. If you believe an automatic ban was not warranted, let us know. Creating a perfect system to distinguish harmful from healthy content is not possible, and we are always trying to improve.

## Final Note

These guidelines are subject to change as the community grows and evolves. We encourage you to review them periodically. Thank you for being a part of our community and helping us create a positive space for everyone.

Together, we can ensure that everyone feels safe and has fun!
